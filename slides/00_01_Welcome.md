# Introduction
Hi there, this is Ray Villalobos welcome to this course.

In this course we're going to create an interface using Vue.js, an easy to learn framework for building user interfaces.

I'll start by showing you how to create a basic Vue.js application and then show you how to organize your applications so that you can use the power of modular programming to organize your apps into different components.

I'll talk about lifecycle methods and how you can use the to load data from a file or an api. Then we'll take a look at how you can communicate between components to build more powerful applications.

We'll take a look at typical tasks that need to be on an interface including working with records by adding them to your data, deleting them from that data and modifying them through the interface.

We'll build an interactive search component that can search as well as sort through your records.

This course is designed as a project based course that will show you a practical way to use Vue.js to build a component based application.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
