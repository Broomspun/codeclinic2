# Vue.js Interface
Component Styles

> > Author Notes:
One of the advantages to having components is that you can isolate everything that belongs to the component in a single place...and that include styles. Vue.js gives you a couple of tools that can help you build components with styles.

## Styles

- `<style>` tags
- More efficient styles
- `scoped` attribute
> > Author Notes:


1. Components can have their own styles using the style tag. You can store styles related to the current component here

1. That's a lot better than just including them in a big page stylesheet because they will be loaded ONLY when a component exists. That makes your applications faster, more efficient and easier to update. You don't have to dig through a huge stylesheet, it's stored directly in with the template.

1. You can add a `scoped` attribute to your style definition and then the styles will work only for the code in the template, which will also make it easier to build your styles.

## Exercise

- Before we get started though, we're starting from a different place than in the last video, so make sure you're loading up the right branch for this exercise.

In your terminal, I'm going to do a git checkout of the branch for this video, which is `02_03b`. If you get an error when you do this because you've been playing around with this, you can issue a git stash command, that will put your changes away and let you switch to a different branch cleanly. Remember if you need help using Git, take a look at [this course][1].

I've added a whole new index.html file, and it's really just a bootstrap template with links to an extra stylesheet called `style.css` as well as to Bootstrap 3 code. Because of the way our automation is set up in webpack, I have these in an assets folder in the process folder. Notice the link assumes this is placed in a builds folder. Again, that's because of the way webpack is set up. Let's talk about what webpack is doing a bit.

First thing we'll need to do is make sure that this file is processed by our automation in webpack, so we'll actually need to import it into our `main.js` file.

`import './assets/style.css';`

This file will be processed and included into our template. Remember that we can run our automation in two modes 'dev' or 'build'. Dev means that we're just going to previewing things locally and build means that we're ready to put this on a server somewhere, so it will bundle things together and compress everything.

Let's go ahead and run that and see what happens.

`npm run build`

Notice that the builds folder is created when we run this and a bunch of files appear now. This is sort of what's happening in the background when we run the other mode, but all of the files are stored in memory and we don't see them. Go ahead and delete the builds folder and run dev.

`npm run dev`

All of this is set up in our webpack.config.js and in our package.json files

Alright, let's get to the changes we need to get [styles in our components][2]
