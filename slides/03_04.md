# Vue.js Interface
Managing Edits

> > Author Notes: You should be getting used to working with components and events and so far we've covered most of the typical types of actions we can perform on data, we've read data, added a record, deleted a record. Let me show you how you can use some special properies in react to do edits.

## Editing

- `contenteditable`
- Creating `ref`s

> > Author Notes: Most modern browsers give us some properties and methods we can use to take care of this.

1. For example, the content editable property allows to edit the HTML in a document.

1. However, editing the HTML is not going to translate to editing our records. sometimes we need to access the data that has been typed in an HTML field. Vue.js gives you a special property called ref that you can add to any HTML field and that will allow us to respond to changes to that field and do whatever we want with it.
