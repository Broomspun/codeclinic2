Getting the most from Code Clinic (00_04)

If you really want to get the most out of Code Clinic, try to create your own solution to the problem before you watch how I've done it. If you've spent time working on the question, you'll have a better idea of some of the difficult paths, and have a better understanding of why I've made certain choices. I've included the source code for my solution in the exercise files. I'm assuming you've already got the necessary tools installed to be able to edit and run the code. If not, I'd recommend you take a look at **RELATED COURSE**.

Code Clinic is a unique opportunity to look over my shoulder as I actually solve coding problems. Keep in mind that my solution isn't the only correct solution. There are always a multitude of ways to solve a problem, but by watching how I approach the task, I hope you'll learn how to become a better programmer yourself.
