# Vue.js Interface
Modifiers and watchers

> > Author Notes: It's time to build the search for our application, and most of what we're going to do here is just a review, but there's a couple of neat things happening here that I'll point out.

## Modifiers and watchers

- `.stop`, <code class="code-warning">.prevent</code>, `.capture`,<br> `.self`, `.once`
- <code class="code-warning">.lazy</code>, `.number`, `.trim`
- `watchers`

> > Author Notes: Modifiers are special properties that you can add to different commands or directives that define how that directive should behave.

1. We've already seen an example in our component that lets us add a record called .prevent. It submits the forms and prevents the default behavior, which would be to reload the page. Checkout [this page][1] for more info on event modifiers.

1. There are also modifiers for input fields you can use, so I'll show you how to use another modifier called .lazy that will prevent our data from binding to a variable until we blur out of the input field. Here's where you can find more information on [input modifiers][2]

1. And those input modifiers work really well for another property of our Vue instance called watchers. Watchers are like computed properties that can respond to changes in your data. Vue can watch the value of a variable and if it notices a change in that variable, it can execute some code. You can get more info on watchers at [this url][3].
