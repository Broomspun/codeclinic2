Deleting in a Deep Chain

> > Author Notes: Now that we have experience with events, let's work on deleting a record, because of the complexity of our app's structure, we'll need to use some additional tools.

## Deep Structures

- `$parent`,`$root`
- [Lodash][1]

> > Author Notes: You can add classes to your code in a few different ways

1. When we emit a custom event to take care of adding a record, it's emitted in the parent of the current component. That works well for adding a records, but our delete buttons are inside a component that's inside a component, thankfully Vue.js gives you some tools like parent and root to be able to navigate our app's structure better.

1. Deleting an object from an existing array can be a bit tricky, so I'm going to bring in one of my favorite libraries called lodash. It does a fantastic job with array operations and will also be helpful when we work with searching and sorting.
