# Vue.js Interface
Named Components

> > Author Notes: Applications generally have more than one piece of functionality, so it's rare to just have a single main component. We can break down our functionality into sub-components and give each a separate unique name.

## App Structure

```xml
<main>
  <add-appointment>
  <search-appointments>
  <appointment-list>
</main>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" contenteditable="true" style="width: 40%;" -->

- `props` attribute
- `import` and `register`

> > Author Notes:

Our application is going to have three main components, one for listing our appointments, one for adding appointments and another for searching through the appointments.

Our main App.vue file is going to hold all three so it's always a good idea to break the functionality into separate components and inside our component. When we do that, we can give each component an individual name.

Each sub-component will need to communicate with the main component to receive some information, we do that through something called props. They look just like HTML attributes. Their job is to pass along data from the main component down to the sub-components.

# App Structure

We'll need to create a file called AppointmentList.vue to hold our appointment list and move our list code as well as our styles there.

In our main application, we can replace our `<ul>` with a new `<appointment-list />` tag.

Now that our component will be in a separate file, we'll need to import it into this file.

`import AppointmentList from './AppointmentList.vue';`


In order for the application to know what to do with our new tag, we'll need to register this tag as a component that points to the content in our external file.

```
components: {
  'appointment-list': AppointmentList
},
```

We'll also need to make sure we pass along the data from this file to the sub-component. We can do that with something called a prop.

```
    <appointment-list
      :appointments="theAppointments"
    />
```

This appointments variable will exist in our sub-component and needs to be tied to the variable in this component with our data, which is called theAppointments.

Alright, now it's time to build our sub-component.
