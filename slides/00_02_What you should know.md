This is not a beginner course and I'm assuming that you've got a lot of prior experience before coming to this course.

You should have experience creating websites and specifically have some type of background with HTML, CSS and a good understanding of JavaScript.

I'm also using the bootstrap framework in this course to create HTML code, so a familiarity with that framework would be useful. If you need help with that, check out Bootstrap Essential Training.

You should be comfortable working with build tools like Npm as well as Git and Github.

So, if you're comfortable with these requirements...let's get started.
