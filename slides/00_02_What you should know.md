# Introduction

This is not a beginner course and I'm assuming that you've got a lot of prior experience before coming to this course.

You should have experience creating websites and specifically have some type of  background with HTML, CSS and a good understanding of [JavaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training-3).

You should also be comfortable working with build tools like [Npm](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/tooling-with-npm-scripts) as well as [Git and Github](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github). 

In this course we'll be using [Webpack]([Webpack](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/webpack-deep-dive)) to manage our build process. You won't need to know too much about how it works, but it would be nice to have some experience with that or another build tool like grunt or gulp.

So, if you're comfortable with these requirements...let's get started.
