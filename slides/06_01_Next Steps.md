Hey there, it's Ray again... Thanks for watching this course.

Vue.js is a fantastic framework that can really help you build great interfaces quickly. The best place to go is of course the [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/). It's a great resource for learning more about Vuejs.

Vue.js can be used in one of two ways and this course focused on building a realistic project using components. We've got a great course where you can dive a bit deeper into some of the concepts discussed in this course especially how you can use Vue.js with and without components, so make sure you [check it out](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vue-js).

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, linkedIn or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.

Once again thanks for watching this course...and don't stop learning.
